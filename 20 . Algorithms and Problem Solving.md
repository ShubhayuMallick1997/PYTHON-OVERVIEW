# 20. **Algorithms and Problem Solving**

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are fundamental to computer science and programming, allowing us to solve a wide variety of tasks, from sorting data to searching through large datasets. Understanding common algorithms and problem-solving techniques will make you a better programmer and help you write more efficient code.

## **1. Sorting Algorithms**

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a list or array in a particular order, usually in ascending or descending order.

### **Common Sorting Algorithms:**

* **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

  ```python
  def bubble_sort(arr):
      n = len(arr)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(0, n-i-1):
              if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                  arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
  ```

* **Selection Sort**: It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

  ```python
  def selection_sort(arr):
      for i in range(len(arr)):
          min_idx = i
          for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
              if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                  min_idx = j
          arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
  ```

* **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm builds the sorted array one item at a time by picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position.

  ```python
  def insertion_sort(arr):
      for i in range(1, len(arr)):
          key = arr[i]
          j = i - 1
          while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
              arr[j+1] = arr[j]
              j -= 1
          arr[j+1] = key
  ```

* **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

  ```python
  def merge_sort(arr):
      if len(arr) > 1:
          mid = len(arr) // 2
          left_half = arr[:mid]
          right_half = arr[mid:]

          merge_sort(left_half)
          merge_sort(right_half)

          i = j = k = 0
          while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
              if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                  arr[k] = left_half[i]
                  i += 1
              else:
                  arr[k] = right_half[j]
                  j += 1
              k += 1

          while i < len(left_half):
              arr[k] = left_half[i]
              i += 1
              k += 1

          while j < len(right_half):
              arr[k] = right_half[j]
              j += 1
              k += 1
  ```

* **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array around the pivot.

  ```python
  def quick_sort(arr):
      if len(arr) <= 1:
          return arr
      pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
      left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
      middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
      right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
      return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
  ```

## **2. Searching Algorithms**

Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element in a list or array.

### **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element one by one until the desired element is found.

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

### **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements at each step.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## **3. Recursion**

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Recursive algorithms are often simpler and more elegant than their iterative counterparts but can be less efficient in certain cases.

### **Example: Factorial Calculation Using Recursion**

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

## **4. Dynamic Programming**

Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### **Example: Fibonacci Sequence Using Dynamic Programming**

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```

## **5. Greedy Algorithms**

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. Greedy algorithms are generally faster than other algorithms but do not always produce the best solution.

### **Example: Coin Change Problem Using Greedy Algorithm**

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    count = 0
    for coin in coins:
        count += amount // coin
        amount = amount % coin
    return count if amount == 0 else -1
```

## **6. Graph Algorithms**

Graph algorithms are used to traverse and analyze graphs, which consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Common graph algorithms include **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

* **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

```python
def dfs(graph, node, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    return visited
```

* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS explores the graph level by level, visiting all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node, end=" ")
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
```

## **7. Backtracking**

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to a problem, where the solution involves choosing one possibility out of many. If the solution doesn't work, the algorithm backtracks to the previous step and tries a different option.

### **Example: N-Queens Problem Using Backtracking**

```python
def solve_n_queens(n):
    board = [["." for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    results = []
    
    def backtrack(row):
        if row == n:
            results.append(["".join(r) for r in board])
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if is_valid(row, col):
                board[row][col] = "Q"
                backtrack(row + 1)
                board[row][col] = "."
    
    def is_valid(row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i][col] == "Q":
                return False
            if col - (row - i) >= 0 and board[i][col - (row - i)] == "Q":
                return False
            if col + (row - i) < n and board[i][col + (row - i)] == "Q":
                return False
        return True

    backtrack(0)
    return results
```
