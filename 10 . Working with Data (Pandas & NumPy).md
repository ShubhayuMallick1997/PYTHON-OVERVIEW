# 10. **Working with Data (Pandas & NumPy)**

Python provides two powerful libraries, **NumPy** and **Pandas**, that are commonly used for handling and analyzing large datasets. These libraries provide high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and tools for data analysis.

## **1. NumPy (Numerical Python)**

NumPy is a library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

### **Creating Arrays with NumPy**

* **Creating a NumPy array** from a list:

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
  print(arr)  # Output: [1 2 3 4]
  ```

* **Creating an array of zeros**:

  ```python
  zeros_arr = np.zeros(5)
  print(zeros_arr)  # Output: [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
  ```

* **Creating an array with a range of numbers**:

  ```python
  range_arr = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
  print(range_arr)  # Output: [0 2 4 6 8]
  ```

### **Array Operations**

NumPy arrays support element-wise operations, which means you can perform mathematical operations on arrays without writing explicit loops.

* **Addition of arrays**:

  ```python
  arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
  result = arr1 + arr2
  print(result)  # Output: [5 7 9]
  ```

* **Array multiplication**:

  ```python
  result = arr1 * arr2
  print(result)  # Output: [4 10 18]
  ```

### **Array Slicing**

You can slice NumPy arrays to get subarrays.

* **Slicing a NumPy array**:

  ```python
  arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
  sliced_arr = arr[1:4]
  print(sliced_arr)  # Output: [20 30 40]
  ```

## **2. Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)**

Pandas is a library that provides high-level data structures like **Series** and **DataFrames** for easy manipulation and analysis of structured data, such as tables or time series.

### **Creating Pandas Data Structures**

* **Creating a Pandas Series**:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  data = [10, 20, 30, 40]
  series = pd.Series(data)
  print(series)
  # Output:
  # 0    10
  # 1    20
  # 2    30
  # 3    40
  # dtype: int64
  ```

* **Creating a Pandas DataFrame**:
  A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional table, like a database table or a spreadsheet.

  ```python
  data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
          'Age': [25, 30, 35],
          'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']}
  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  print(df)
  ```

  Output:

  ```
      Name  Age         City
  0    Alice   25     New York
  1      Bob   30  Los Angeles
  2  Charlie   35      Chicago
  ```

### **DataFrame Operations**

* **Accessing Columns**:
  You can access the columns of a DataFrame using the column name.

  ```python
  print(df['Name'])  # Output: 0      Alice  1        Bob  2    Charlie
  ```

* **Selecting Rows**:
  You can select rows using `iloc` (integer-location based indexing) or `loc` (label-based indexing).

  ```python
  print(df.iloc[1])  # Output: Name           Bob
                     #         Age            30
                     #         City    Los Angeles
  ```

* **Filtering Data**:
  You can filter rows based on conditions.

  ```python
  filtered_df = df[df['Age'] > 28]
  print(filtered_df)
  ```

  Output:

  ```
      Name  Age         City
  1    Bob   30  Los Angeles
  2  Charlie   35      Chicago
  ```

* **Adding a New Column**:
  You can add a new column to a DataFrame.

  ```python
  df['Salary'] = [50000, 60000, 70000]
  print(df)
  ```

  Output:

  ```
      Name  Age         City  Salary
  0    Alice   25     New York   50000
  1      Bob   30  Los Angeles   60000
  2  Charlie   35      Chicago   70000
  ```

### **Reading and Writing Data with Pandas**

Pandas makes it easy to read data from different file formats, such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.

* **Reading a CSV file**:

  ```python
  df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
  print(df)
  ```

* **Writing to a CSV file**:

  ```python
  df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
  ```

### **Handling Missing Data**

Pandas provides powerful tools to handle missing data in datasets.

* **Checking for missing data**:

  ```python
  print(df.isnull())  # Checks for NaN values
  ```

* **Filling missing data**:

  ```python
  df.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Replace NaN with 0
  ```

## **3. Why Use Pandas and NumPy?**

* **Efficiency**: NumPy and Pandas provide high-performance data structures that are optimized for handling large datasets.
* **Ease of Use**: They provide a simple and intuitive interface for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Integration**: These libraries integrate well with other scientific libraries in Python, such as **SciPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**.
* **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: With their rich set of features, Pandas and NumPy make tasks like data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis much easier.

Mastering Pandas and NumPy is essential for anyone working in data analysis, data science, or machine learning. These libraries provide the building blocks for handling large datasets efficiently and conducting complex analyses.
