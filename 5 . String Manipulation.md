# 5. **String Manipulation**

String manipulation is one of the most common tasks in programming. In Python, strings are sequences of characters, and Python provides several methods to handle and manipulate strings.

## **Basic String Operations**

* **Concatenation**: You can combine strings using the `+` operator.

  ```python
  greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"
  print(greeting)  # Output: Hello World
  ```

* **Repetition**: You can repeat strings using the `*` operator.

  ```python
  repeated = "Python" * 3
  print(repeated)  # Output: PythonPythonPython
  ```

* **Indexing and Slicing**: You can access specific characters in a string using indices. Python uses **zero-based indexing**, so the first character is at index `0`.

  ```python
  text = "Python"
  print(text[0])  # Output: P
  print(text[1:4])  # Output: yth
  ```

## **String Methods**

Python strings come with many built-in methods that allow you to perform a variety of tasks, such as modifying, searching, or formatting strings. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:

* **`upper()`**: Converts the string to uppercase.

  ```python
  print("hello".upper())  # Output: HELLO
  ```

* **`lower()`**: Converts the string to lowercase.

  ```python
  print("HELLO".lower())  # Output: hello
  ```

* **`strip()`**: Removes leading and trailing spaces.

  ```python
  text = "  Python  "
  print(text.strip())  # Output: Python
  ```

* **`replace()`**: Replaces a specified phrase with another string.

  ```python
  text = "Hello World"
  print(text.replace("World", "Python"))  # Output: Hello Python
  ```

* **`split()`**: Splits the string into a list based on a delimiter.

  ```python
  sentence = "Python is fun"
  words = sentence.split(" ")
  print(words)  # Output: ['Python', 'is', 'fun']
  ```

## **String Formatting**

Python offers several ways to format strings:

* **Old-style formatting (`%`)**:

  ```python
  name = "Alice"
  age = 30
  print("Hello %s, you are %d years old" % (name, age))
  # Output: Hello Alice, you are 30 years old
  ```

* **`str.format()` method**:

  ```python
  print("Hello {}, you are {} years old".format(name, age))
  # Output: Hello Alice, you are 30 years old
  ```

* **F-strings (Python 3.6+)**:

  ```python
  print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old")
  # Output: Hello Alice, you are 30 years old
  ```

## **Escaping Special Characters**

Strings can contain special characters (such as quotes, newlines, or tabs), which need to be escaped using the backslash (`\`) character.

* **Escaping quotes**:

  ```python
  text = "He said, \"Hello!\""
  print(text)  # Output: He said, "Hello!"
  ```

* **Newline and Tab**:

  ```python
  text = "First line\nSecond line"
  print(text)
  # Output:
  # First line
  # Second line
  ```

## **String Checking Methods**

These methods help you test properties of a string:

* **`isalpha()`**: Checks if the string contains only alphabetic characters.

  ```python
  print("Python".isalpha())  # Output: True
  ```

* **`isdigit()`**: Checks if the string contains only digits.

  ```python
  print("123".isdigit())  # Output: True
  ```

* **`startswith()`** and **`endswith()`**: Check if a string starts or ends with a specific substring.

  ```python
  print("Python".startswith("Py"))  # Output: True
  print("Python".endswith("on"))  # Output: True
  ```

## **Joining Strings**

You can join elements of a list into a single string using the `join()` method.

```python
words = ["Python", "is", "awesome"]
sentence = " ".join(words)
print(sentence)  # Output: Python is awesome
```

String manipulation is a powerful feature in Python, and mastering these operations will allow you to handle and process text efficiently. Whether you are working with simple strings or manipulating more complex data, knowing these methods is essential for almost every Python project.
