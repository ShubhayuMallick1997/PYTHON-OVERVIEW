# 8. **Regular Expressions**

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They allow you to search for specific patterns in strings, such as validating input or extracting data. Python provides the `re` module to work with regular expressions.

#### **1. Importing the `re` Module**

To use regular expressions in Python, you need to import the `re` module:

```python
import re
```

## **2. Basic Syntax of Regular Expressions**

Regular expressions are made up of various symbols and characters that define search patterns. Some of the most common components are:

* **`^`**: Matches the start of a string.
* **`$`**: Matches the end of a string.
* **`.`**: Matches any character except a newline.
* **`[]`**: Matches any character inside the square brackets.
* **`*`**: Matches zero or more repetitions of the preceding element.
* **`+`**: Matches one or more repetitions of the preceding element.
* **`?`**: Matches zero or one repetition of the preceding element.
* **`\d`**: Matches any digit (0-9).
* **`\w`**: Matches any alphanumeric character (letters and digits).
* **`\s`**: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, etc.).
* **`()`**: Groups patterns together.
* **`|`**: Acts like an OR operator between expressions.

#### **3. Searching with `re.search()`**

The `re.search()` function searches for a pattern in a string. It returns a match object if the pattern is found, or `None` if no match is found.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"hello"
text = "hello world"
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Pattern found!")
else:
    print("Pattern not found.")
```

Output:

```
Pattern found!
```

## **4. Matching Patterns with `re.match()`**

The `re.match()` function checks if the pattern matches the beginning of the string. If the match is found, it returns a match object; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"^hello"
text = "hello world"
match = re.match(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Pattern matched!")
else:
    print("Pattern did not match.")
```

Output:

```
Pattern matched!
```

## **5. Finding All Matches with `re.findall()`**

The `re.findall()` function returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"  # Matches one or more digits
text = "The price is 100 dollars and 50 cents."
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)  # Output: ['100', '50']
```

## **6. Replacing Text with `re.sub()`**

The `re.sub()` function is used to replace parts of a string that match a pattern with a new string.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"  # Matches one or more digits
text = "The price is 100 dollars and 50 cents."
result = re.sub(pattern, "X", text)

print(result)  # Output: "The price is X dollars and X cents."
```

## **7. Using `re.split()`**

The `re.split()` function splits a string at occurrences of a pattern and returns a list of the substrings.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\s+"  # Matches one or more whitespace characters
text = "This is a test string."
result = re.split(pattern, text)

print(result)  # Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'string.']
```

## **8. Example: Validating Email Addresses**

Regular expressions are commonly used for input validation. For example, you can use regex to check if an email address is in a valid format.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$"
email = "example@example.com"

if re.match(pattern, email):
    print("Valid email address")
else:
    print("Invalid email address")
```

Output:

```
Valid email address
```

## **9. Grouping with Parentheses**

Parentheses in regular expressions are used to group patterns together. You can access the matched groups using `.group()`.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"(\d+)\s+(\w+)"
text = "100 dollars"
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print(f"Amount: {match.group(1)}")
    print(f"Currency: {match.group(2)}")
```

Output:

```
Amount: 100
Currency: dollars
```

## **10. Compiling Regular Expressions**

You can compile regular expressions for efficiency, especially if you need to use the same pattern multiple times.

Example:

```python
import re

pattern = re.compile(r"\d+")
text = "There are 100 apples and 50 oranges."

matches = pattern.findall(text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['100', '50']
```

## **Why Use Regular Expressions?**

Regular expressions provide a powerful way to:

* **Search** for specific patterns in text.
* **Validate** input data, such as email addresses or phone numbers.
* **Extract** data from unstructured text.
* **Transform** text, such as replacing or formatting strings.

Although regular expressions may seem complex at first, mastering them can significantly improve your ability to handle and manipulate text in Python.
