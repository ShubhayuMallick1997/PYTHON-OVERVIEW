# 2. **Control Flow**

Control flow refers to the order in which individual statements or instructions are executed in a Python program. It allows you to control the execution of your program based on conditions or repeatedly through loops. The two main concepts in control flow are **conditional statements** and **loops**.

## **Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)**

Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. The basic structure is as follows:

* **`if` statement**: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
* **`elif` (else if) statement**: If the initial `if` condition is false, you can check another condition.
* **`else` statement**: Executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are true.

Example:

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")
```

In this example, since the condition `age >= 18` is true, the output will be:

```
You are an adult.
```

## **Loops (for, while)**

Loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code multiple times.

1. **`for` loop**: It’s used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) and executing a block of code for each item.

   ```python
   for i in range(5):  # range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4
       print(i)
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   0
   1
   2
   3
   4
   ```

2. **`while` loop**: It executes a block of code as long as the condition is true.

   ```python
   count = 0
   while count < 5:
       print(count)
       count += 1  # Increment the counter
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   0
   1
   2
   3
   4
   ```

## **Break and Continue**

* **`break`**: Terminates the loop completely.

  ```python
  for i in range(10):
      if i == 5:
          break  # Stops the loop when i is 5
      print(i)
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  ```

* **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      if i == 3:
          continue  # Skips when i is 3
      print(i)
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  0
  1
  2
  4
  ```

## **Pass Statement**

* **`pass`**: It is a placeholder used when a statement is syntactically required but no code needs to be executed. It’s used in loops or functions that are yet to be written.

  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      pass  # Do nothing
  ```

Control flow is essential for creating dynamic and interactive programs. It allows you to make decisions, repeat tasks, and control the execution path based on specific conditions.
