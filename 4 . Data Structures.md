# 4. **Data Structures**

In Python, **data structures** are used to store and organize data efficiently. Python provides several built-in data structures, each with different features that make them suited to specific tasks. The most commonly used data structures in Python are **lists**, **tuples**, **sets**, and **dictionaries**.

## **1. Lists**

A **list** is an ordered collection of items, which can be of any type (integers, strings, other lists, etc.). Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation.

* **Creating a list**:

  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

* **Accessing elements**:
  List elements can be accessed using indices. Remember that Python indexing starts at 0.

  ```python
  print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
  ```

* **Modifying elements**:
  Since lists are mutable, you can change an element by directly accessing its index.

  ```python
  my_list[2] = 10
  print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 10, 4]
  ```

* **List methods**:

  * `.append()`: Adds an element to the end of the list.
  * `.remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.
  * `.pop()`: Removes and returns an element at a specific index.
  * `.sort()`: Sorts the list in place.

  ```python
  my_list.append(5)
  my_list.sort()
  ```

## **2. Tuples**

A **tuple** is similar to a list, but it is **immutable** (cannot be changed after creation). Tuples are useful when you want to ensure that the data cannot be altered.

* **Creating a tuple**:

  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
  ```

* **Accessing elements**:
  Tuples can be accessed in the same way as lists using indices.

  ```python
  print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 2
  ```

* **Tuple operations**:
  Since tuples are immutable, you can't modify them directly. However, you can concatenate them or slice them to create new tuples.

  ```python
  new_tuple = my_tuple + (5, 6)
  ```

## **3. Sets**

A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate elements and do not maintain any specific order.

* **Creating a set**:

  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
  ```

* **Adding and removing elements**:
  Sets allow the addition and removal of elements.

  ```python
  my_set.add(5)
  my_set.remove(3)
  ```

* **Set operations**:
  Sets support mathematical operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

  ```python
  another_set = {3, 4, 5, 6}
  union_set = my_set | another_set  # Union
  intersection_set = my_set & another_set  # Intersection
  difference_set = my_set - another_set  # Difference
  ```

## **4. Dictionaries**

A **dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. It is a powerful structure for storing related data and allows quick lookup of values based on keys.

* **Creating a dictionary**:

  ```python
  my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
  ```

* **Accessing values**:
  You can access dictionary values using keys.

  ```python
  print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: Alice
  ```

* **Modifying values**:
  Dictionary values can be updated by referencing the key.

  ```python
  my_dict["age"] = 26
  ```

* **Dictionary methods**:

  * `.keys()`: Returns a list of all the keys.
  * `.values()`: Returns a list of all the values.
  * `.items()`: Returns a list of key-value pairs (tuples).

  ```python
  keys = my_dict.keys()  # Returns dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'city'])
  ```

## Choosing the Right Data Structure

* Use a **list** when the order of elements matters, and you need to change them.
* Use a **tuple** when the data is immutable and order matters.
* Use a **set** when you need a collection of unique elements and don't care about the order.
* Use a **dictionary** when you need a key-value pair structure for fast lookups.

Data structures form the backbone of efficient programming. Understanding when and how to use each type can greatly enhance the performance and readability of your code.
