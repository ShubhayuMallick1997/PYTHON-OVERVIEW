# 32.  **Python for Data Science and Machine Learning**

Python is one of the most widely used languages for data science and machine learning. It provides an extensive ecosystem of libraries to perform tasks such as data analysis, visualization, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). Here's an overview of some of the key libraries and techniques used for data science and machine learning in Python.

## **1. Data Analysis with Pandas**

**Pandas** is the primary library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides high-performance data structures like **DataFrames** and **Series** to manage and analyze data.

### **Basic Operations in Pandas**

1. **Install Pandas**:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

2. **Reading Data**:
   Pandas can read from various data formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   Pandas makes it easy to clean and manipulate data, such as handling missing values, duplicates, and renaming columns.

```python
# Handling missing data
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Fill missing values with 0

# Dropping rows with missing data
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Renaming columns
df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'}, inplace=True)
```

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   Pandas offers several functions for descriptive statistics, summary statistics, and group operations.

```python
# Descriptive statistics
print(df.describe())

# Grouping data by a column and calculating the mean
grouped_data = df.groupby('column_name').mean()
print(grouped_data)
```

## **2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn**

**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are the go-to libraries for data visualization in Python. While **Matplotlib** provides fine-grained control over plots, **Seaborn** offers a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### **Install Matplotlib and Seaborn**

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

### **Basic Visualization with Matplotlib**

1. **Line Plot**:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple line plot
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Simple Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.show()
```

2. **Bar Plot**:

```python
categories = ['A', 'B', 'C']
values = [3, 7, 2]

plt.bar(categories, values)
plt.title("Bar Plot")
plt.show()
```

### **Advanced Visualization with Seaborn**

1. **Pairplot** (for visualizing relationships in a dataset):

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Load sample dataset from Seaborn
data = sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Plot pairplot
sns.pairplot(data, hue="species")
plt.show()
```

2. **Heatmap** (for visualizing correlation matrices):

```python
correlation_matrix = data.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.show()
```

## **3. Machine Learning with Scikit-learn**

**Scikit-learn** is a powerful and widely-used library for machine learning in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, supporting various machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.

### **Install Scikit-learn**

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

### **Basic Steps in Machine Learning with Scikit-learn**

1. **Loading and Splitting Data**:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

2. **Training a Model (e.g., Logistic Regression)**:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Initialize the model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   Scikit-learn allows you to fine-tune hyperparameters using methods like **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define hyperparameters to search
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'solver': ['lbfgs', 'saga']}

# Initialize GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(max_iter=200), param_grid, cv=5)

# Fit the grid search
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the best parameters
print(f"Best Parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
```

## **4. Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch**

**TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** are the two most popular frameworks for deep learning in Python. These libraries allow you to build, train, and deploy neural networks for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

### **Install TensorFlow and PyTorch**

```bash
pip install tensorflow torch
```

### **TensorFlow: Basic Example**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define a simple neural network model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (using dummy data for demonstration)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 784)  # Dummy data
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)  # Dummy labels

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

### **PyTorch: Basic Example**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple neural network model
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize the model
model = SimpleNN()

# Define loss and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Dummy data for training
X_train = torch.randn(100, 784)  # Dummy data
y_train = torch.randint(0, 10, (100,))  # Dummy labels

# Train the model
for epoch in range(5):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X_train)
    loss = loss_fn(output, y_train)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

## **5. Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK or SpaCy**

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Libraries like **NLTK** and **SpaCy** are commonly used for text analysis, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and more.

### **Install NLTK and SpaCy**

```bash
pip install nltk spacy
```

### **Text Processing with NLTK**

1. **Tokenization**:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

text = "Python is amazing!"
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)  # Output: ['Python', 'is', 'amazing', '!']
```

2. **Stopword Removal**:

```python
nltk.download('stopwords')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_words = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
print(filtered_words)  # Output: ['Python', 'amazing', '!']
```

### **Text Processing with SpaCy**

1. **Load a SpaCy Model**:

```python
import spacy

# Load the English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Process a text
doc = nlp("Python is amazing!")

# Tokenization and part-of-speech tagging
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_)
```

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:

```python
doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```
