### 3. **Functions**

Functions are a fundamental concept in Python and programming in general. They allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks, which can make your programs cleaner and easier to manage. Functions can take inputs, perform operations, and return results.

#### **Defining Functions**

To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you can specify parameters (inputs for the function), and inside the function body, you define the code to be executed.

Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This function, `greet`, takes one parameter (`name`) and prints a greeting. To call the function, simply use its name with the argument:

```python
greet("Alice")
```

Output:

```
Hello, Alice!
```

#### **Arguments and Return Values**

* **Arguments**: Functions can take one or more arguments (also called parameters), which allow you to pass data into the function for it to work with.

  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```

  Calling `add(2, 3)` would return `5`.

* **Return values**: Functions can return values using the `return` keyword. This allows you to send results back to the place where the function was called.

  ```python
  def multiply(a, b):
      return a * b
  result = multiply(4, 5)
  print(result)  # Output: 20
  ```

#### **Lambda Functions**

A **lambda function** is a small anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It is often used for short, simple functions that are needed temporarily.

Example:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
```

Lambda functions are typically used when a small function is required for a short period and are often used in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or `sorted()`.

#### **Scope and Lifetime of Variables**

* **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function are local to that function. They can only be accessed within the function where they are defined.

  ```python
  def example():
      x = 10  # Local variable
      print(x)
  example()
  ```

* **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function are global. They can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

  ```python
  x = 10  # Global variable
  def example():
      print(x)
  example()  # Output: 10
  ```

* **Global vs. Local Variables**: If a variable is declared both globally and locally, Python uses the local version within the function. To modify a global variable inside a function, you must declare it as `global`.

Example:

```python
x = 10  # Global variable
def example():
    global x  # Referencing global variable
    x = 20
example()
print(x)  # Output: 20
```

#### **Function Documentation**

It's good practice to document your functions using **docstrings**. A docstring is a string literal placed at the beginning of a function to describe what it does. Itâ€™s accessible via the `help()` function and provides documentation for the function.

Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    This function greets the person passed in the 'name' parameter.
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

To view the docstring:

```python
help(greet)
```

Functions are a powerful tool in Python that help you break down your program into smaller, manageable chunks. By organizing your code into functions, you can make your code more readable, reusable, and easier to debug.
