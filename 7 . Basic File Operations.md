# 7. **Basic File Operations**

Working with files is an essential part of programming. Python provides built-in functions and modules to read, write, and manipulate files. The most common file operations are opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

## **1. Opening Files**

To work with a file in Python, you first need to **open** it using the built-in `open()` function. You can specify the file's path and the mode in which you want to open it (e.g., read, write, append).

```python
# Syntax: open(filename, mode)
file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Open file in read mode ('r')
```

The `open()` function returns a file object, which you can use to perform operations on the file.

## **2. File Modes**

When opening a file, you can specify different modes:

* **`'r'`**: Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading.
* **`'w'`**: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file or truncates the existing file.
* **`'a'`**: Append mode. Opens the file for appending (adds content to the end).
* **`'rb'`**: Read mode in binary.
* **`'wb'`**: Write mode in binary.

Example of opening a file in write mode:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")
```

## **3. Reading Files**

Once the file is open, you can read its contents using methods like `.read()`, `.readline()`, and `.readlines()`.

* **`.read()`**: Reads the entire file.

  ```python
  file = open("example.txt", "r")
  content = file.read()
  print(content)
  ```

* **`.readline()`**: Reads a single line from the file.

  ```python
  file = open("example.txt", "r")
  line = file.readline()
  print(line)
  ```

* **`.readlines()`**: Reads all lines in the file and returns them as a list.

  ```python
  file = open("example.txt", "r")
  lines = file.readlines()
  print(lines)
  ```

## **4. Writing to Files**

You can write data to a file using the `.write()` or `.writelines()` methods. Writing to a file will overwrite the existing content if the file is opened in write mode (`'w'`).

* **`.write()`**: Writes a string to the file.

  ```python
  file = open("example.txt", "w")
  file.write("Hello, World!")
  file.close()
  ```

* **`.writelines()`**: Writes a list of strings to the file.

  ```python
  lines = ["Hello\n", "World\n"]
  file = open("example.txt", "w")
  file.writelines(lines)
  file.close()
  ```

#### **5. Appending to a File**

If you want to add data to the end of the file without overwriting its existing contents, open the file in append mode (`'a'`).

```python
file = open("example.txt", "a")
file.write("New line added to the file.\n")
file.close()
```

## **6. Closing Files**

It's important to **close** the file after you're done with it using the `.close()` method. This ensures that any changes are saved and resources are released.

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()
```

## **7. Using `with` Statement for File Handling**

A more efficient and preferred way to handle files is by using the `with` statement. It automatically closes the file after you're done, even if an error occurs during the file operation.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed without needing to explicitly call `.close()`.

## **8. File Exceptions**

While working with files, itâ€™s common to encounter errors like file not found, permission denied, or other issues. You can handle these errors using **error handling** with `try` and `except`.

Example:

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist!")
finally:
    file.close()
```

## **9. File Paths**

When specifying the file to open, you can use either a **relative** or **absolute path**:

* **Relative path**: Relative to the current working directory.

  ```python
  open("folder/example.txt", "r")
  ```

* **Absolute path**: Full path from the root directory.

  ```python
  open("/home/user/folder/example.txt", "r")
  ```

## **10. Working with CSV Files**

Python provides a built-in `csv` module to read and write CSV files, which are commonly used for storing tabular data.

```python
import csv

# Reading CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

# Writing to CSV file
data = [['Name', 'Age'], ['Alice', 30], ['Bob', 25]]
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)
```

## **Why File Handling Matters**

* **Persistence**: Files allow you to save data between program runs, making your application persistent.
* **Data exchange**: Files are commonly used to share data with other systems (e.g., logs, reports, data processing).
* **Efficiency**: You can handle large amounts of data without storing everything in memory at once.

Mastering file operations in Python is a fundamental skill for many applications, ranging from data processing to web development.
